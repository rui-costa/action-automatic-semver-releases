## Versioning

All commits to `main` will generate a new `PATCH` version of this action. If you want to use the most recent one, keep the `@latest` tag.

## Security

Security is a very important topic. As explained in the bullet above, any changes will generate a new tag. But even by tagging a specific version you can never be 100% sure of the code that will run on your workflow. If you don't trust the code that will be execute, don't worry, there are other ways.

- You can fork the repo for yourself and use it, validate the code and use it as is. Or,
- You can copy the workflow `resources/release.yml` into your repo and get the same value from this GitHub action. There is no reference to any third-party actions or software.

> **_Disadvantage:_** If you opt by the `resources/release.yml` approach, you will not receive any updates when new features are released.
